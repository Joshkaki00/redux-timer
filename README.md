# 🕒 React Redux Timer App

A multi-timer web application built with React and Redux Toolkit, inspired by productivity tools like Toggl. This app allows users to manage multiple independent timers simultaneously.

## ✨ Features

- ➕ Start and manage multiple independent timers
- ⏸️ Pause and resume timers
- ⏹️ Stop and reset timers
- 🧠 Real-time updates and state management
- 📦 Persistent storage of timer data
- 🎨 Modern, responsive UI

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **React** – Component-based UI library
- **Redux Toolkit** – State management
- **JavaScript** – ES6+ functional programming
- **React Hooks** – `useEffect`, `useSelector`, `useDispatch`
- **setInterval / clearInterval** – Real-time updates
- **CSS Modules** – Styled components

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

## 🧠 Learning Outcomes

This project demonstrates:

- ✅ Structuring Redux state for complex applications
- ✅ Managing real-time updates and side effects
